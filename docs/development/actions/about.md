# GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference) are used to test, build and deploy Threat Dragon.
These actions live in the `.github/workflows` directory.

## Workflows (TBD)
Workflows are a collection of jobs, which each can have a collection of steps.
This section of the documentation will explain the different jobs that comprise Threat Dragon's continuous delivery system.
